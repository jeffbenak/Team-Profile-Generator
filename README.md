# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

This project is a command line prompt that generates an html file in the form of a team profile. You can add an engineer or intern role to your profile, but can only have one manager. Once the file is generated, it will be displayed in an html file and organized with all the information entered by the user.

## Installation

- Download the file from github.
- Run npm install so you have all the required components to run the program.

## Usage

- You must invoke the application using node index.js, and then answer each question for the manager, and then from there decide if you would like to add an intern or engineer. 
- Once you finish adding people to your team, you can select create team, which will generate a team profile that uses all of the information you entered in the prompt.
